# ü™ô StreamVault Credits System Documentation

## Overview

StreamVault Credits (SVC) is an off-chain ledger system that abstracts gas fees for users, providing predictable upload costs and superior UX compared to direct cryptocurrency payments.

## üéØ Design Philosophy

### Problems Solved
- **Gas Fee Volatility**: Upload costs fluctuate with network conditions
- **User Experience**: Creators don't need to understand blockchain gas mechanics
- **Barrier to Entry**: No need for users to hold USDC or manage wallets for uploads
- **Cost Optimization**: Platform can batch uploads to reduce total gas costs by 40-60%

### Benefits
- **Predictable Pricing**: Fixed credit costs regardless of gas fluctuations
- **Fiat Integration**: Purchase credits with credit cards, PayPal
- **Revenue Generation**: 20-30% margin on credit sales
- **Future Scalability**: Easy migration to on-chain tokens later

## üí∞ Credit Economics

### Credit Packages

| Package | Credits | Bonus | USD Price | Cost per Credit | Best for |
|---------|---------|-------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Starter** | 100 | 0 | $5.00 | $0.05 | New creators |
| **Creator** | 500 | 50 | $20.00 | $0.04 | Regular uploaders |
| **Pro** | 2000 | 300 | $60.00 | $0.03 | Heavy users |

### Upload Costs (Predictable Pricing)

| Upload Type | Credit Cost | USD Equivalent | Features |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **Audio Track** | 15 credits | ~$0.45-0.75 | Standard upload |
| **Video Content** | 50 credits | ~$1.50-2.50 | Higher processing cost |
| **Album Bundle** | 40 credits | Bulk discount | Multiple tracks |
| **Premium Encryption** | +10 credits | Premium feature | AES-256 encryption |
| **Quality Variants** | +5 credits | Multiple formats | HQ, standard, preview |
| **Custom Thumbnail** | +3 credits | Visual enhancement | Artwork upload |

### Batch Discounts
- **5+ files**: Automatic 15% discount
- **Platform batching**: Additional 40-60% gas savings passed to users

## üöÄ System Architecture

### Off-Chain Credit Ledger
```typescript
interface UserCredits {
  balance: number;        // Available credits
  totalEarned: number;    // Lifetime earnings
  totalSpent: number;     // Lifetime spending
  totalPurchased: number; // Real money purchases
}
```

### Gas Management Strategy
```typescript
interface GasOptimization {
  batchProcessing: boolean;    // Group 3-20 uploads
  optimalTiming: Date;         // Low gas periods
  costSavings: number;         // Savings from batching
  fallbackStrategy: string;    // If batching fails
}
```

## üîÑ How It Works

### 1. User Purchase Flow
```typescript
// User buys credits with fiat
const purchase = await creditManager.purchaseCredits(userId, 'creator', {
  paymentMethod: 'stripe',
  paymentId: 'pi_1234567890',
});
// Result: 550 credits (500 + 50 bonus) for $20
```

### 2. Upload Cost Estimation
```typescript
// Estimate before upload
const estimate = await creditManager.estimateUploadCost({
  fileType: 'audio',
  fileCount: 3,
  features: ['premium_encryption', 'quality_variants'],
  userId: 'user_123'
});
// Result: 60 credits (45 base + 15 features)
```

### 3. Gas-Optimized Processing
```typescript
// Platform handles gas efficiently
const batch = await gasManager.queueUpload(file, 'medium');
// Batches with other uploads, pays gas in USDC
// User only sees: "Upload completed - 15 credits used"
```

### 4. Sponsored Uploads
```typescript
// New creators get free uploads
const sponsorship = await creditManager.checkSponsorshipEligibility(userId);
// Result: { eligible: true, remainingSponsored: 4 }
```

## üìä Database Schema

### Core Tables
- **`user_credits`** - Credit balances and lifetime stats
- **`credit_transactions`** - All credit movements with context
- **`credit_purchases`** - Fiat-to-credit purchases via Stripe/PayPal
- **`filecoin_gas_transactions`** - Platform gas costs and optimization
- **`sponsored_uploads`** - Free uploads for new creators

### Key Relationships
```sql
-- User has one credit account
users -> user_credits (1:1)

-- Credit transactions track all movements
user_credits -> credit_transactions (1:many)

-- Gas transactions track platform costs
filecoin_gas_transactions -> file_uploads (1:many)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation

### Credit Manager Service
```typescript
import { creditManager } from './services/CreditManager';

// Check balance
const balance = await creditManager.getUserCredits(userId);

// Purchase credits
const result = await creditManager.purchaseCredits(userId, 'creator', paymentData);

// Spend credits for upload
await creditManager.spendCreditsForUpload(userId, 15, {
  fileUploadId: 'upload_123',
  description: 'Audio track upload',
});
```

### Gas Manager Service
```typescript
import { filecoinGasManager } from './services/FilecoinGasManager';

// Queue file for batched upload
const batch = await filecoinGasManager.queueUpload({
  id: 'file_123',
  file: audioFile,
  metadata: { title: 'My Song', isPremium: true },
  userId: 'user_123'
});

// Platform automatically processes batches for optimal gas costs
```

### Database Operations
```typescript
import { creditDB, gasDB } from './lib/database';

// Check if user has enough credits
const hasCredits = await creditDB.hasCredits(userId, 15);

// Get platform statistics
const stats = await creditDB.getPlatformStats(30);
```

## üéÅ Sponsorship System

### New Creator Bonus
- **First 5 uploads FREE** for new creators
- Automatically applied when wallet address is null or recent signup
- Tracked in `sponsored_uploads` table

### Milestone Bonuses
- **1K plays**: 25 bonus credits
- **5K followers**: 50 bonus credits
- **First creator coin**: 100 bonus credits

### Implementation
```typescript
// Check eligibility
const sponsorship = await creditManager.checkSponsorshipEligibility(userId);

if (sponsorship.eligible) {
  await creditManager.createSponsoredUpload(userId, sponsorship.reason, {
    fileUploadId: 'upload_123',
    creditsCost: 15,
    usdValue: 0.60,
    gasValue: 0.48
  });
}
```
